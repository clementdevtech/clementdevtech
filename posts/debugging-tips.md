Debugging is a fundamental skill that every developer must master. It is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing bugs or errors in your code. Debugging can often be a daunting task, but with the right techniques, you can simplify the process and become a more effective developer. Here are several strategies to enhance your debugging skills.

## 1. Understand the Problem

Before jumping into the code, it's crucial to understand the problem at hand. Take a moment to answer the following questions:
- **What is the expected behavior of the application?**
- **What is the actual behavior?**
- **Are there any error messages or warnings?**

### Example:
Suppose you have a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, but it returns an incorrect value. Start by defining what the expected total should be and compare it to the actual output.

## 2. Use Print Statements Effectively

One of the simplest debugging techniques involves using print statements (or logging) to monitor the flow of your program. 

### Key Tips for Effective Logging:
- **Log Variable Values**: Check the values of variables at crucial points in your code to understand how data is changing.
- **Log Function Calls**: Note when functions are called and the arguments they receive.
- **Log Errors**: Capture errors and exceptions to gain insight into what went wrong.

### Example:

- **This code log to console the output given by the code.
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
    let total = 0;
    items.forEach(item => {
        console.log("Processing item:", item);
        total += item.price;
    });
    console.log("Total price calculated:", total);
    return total;
}
